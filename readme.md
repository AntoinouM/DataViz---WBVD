# Introduction to data science

- Hard to understand behaviour of data without visualisation.
- We use a stattistical approach, a simple summary statistics table (mean, variance...)
- But it is not enough, we also need visualizations to see behaviour. Statistics can be the same but data can be really different

## D3 (Data Driven Documents)

> A total freedom to manage and create visualization

D3 is not a framework but alibrary that can be used in a library. (Have a look at Svelte because goes quite well)

### What is D3
- A library that helps to create custom interactive visualizations in browser (or mobile)
- It is using SVG, HTNL5, CSS3 and JS
- Also allows us to create any kind of visual diagram and to manipulate DOM.

- specialy known for animation and interaction
- create physics simulations

Have a look at https://pudding.cool to see example of stories

### D3's Features
- Uses Web standards
- Data driven - fetch data from remote server...

#### Core concepts

1) Working with SVG's
2) Data Binding
3) Scales
4) Margins and axes (providing context to visualisation)
5) General Update Pattern

### Hands on
see code


> npm create vite@latest
> cd ...
> npm install
> -> import  * as d3 from 'd3'

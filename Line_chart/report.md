# Box Plot

I decided to do a box-plot.
I think thi visualisation is great to understand the difference between all season. It gives a lot of information.

I added some interactivity with a custom calendar element to display a day on the graph and have a direct comparison with all the season (with displayed statistic element: min, max, quartiles, median).

I think this solution is a good work around the problem.

> Some element can be improved (the infobox and the line display are no updated after going back to unknown data from the dataset)

my code is available on my github:
